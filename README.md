# `ilab` Bar

This is a simple macOS status bar that allows you to start/stop/view [ilab](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/) from the menu bar.

## Prerequisites

TODO

## Installation

The app can be installed with a single `make install-app` command. This will create a new application bundle in `/Applications/ilab-bar.app`.

## Running the tests

To run all tests, use:

```
make test
```

You can also run [scripts/run_tests.sh](scripts/run_tests.sh) directly with additional `pytest` args to control which tests are run.
